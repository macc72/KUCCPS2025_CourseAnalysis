# KUCCPS2025_CourseAnalysis
This is an analysis for the KUCCPS university courses selection for major courses in Kenya. 
I used jupyter notebook and libraries such as pandas, numpy and matplotlib to analyse some of the available courses.
I'm currently working on analysing more courses and later intergrate machine learning techniques and libraries to predict the next cluster points based off trend.

This is an example: (Computer science cluster points analysis graph)
